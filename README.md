# Fast Lane Feast - [PLAY HERE!](https://tharusanv.github.io/FastLaneFeast_LearningUnityProject3D/)

### Description
As someone who has already graduated and is looking to get a job in the competitive technology industry, it is important I keep myself motivated when I don't have the added pressure of university forcing me to. That said, since graduating I have been working on projects that do just that, keep myself motivated whilst also allowing myself to learn new technologies. 
Introducing, 'Fast Lane Feast', my first 3D game developed in Unity (C#)   

My choice of Unity(C#) for this project came down to two reasons. The first being that my computer hardware struggles to run Unreal which is another gaming engine. With Unity being more lightweight, having a lot of community support and it being up there with unreal as a major game engine on the market, it is perfect for what I want to do. The second reason being, with Unity being based on C# it allows myself to have more control over my code. Whereas from what I understand, Unreal follows a balanced approach when it comes to making games where developers can either use blueprints or follow traditional coding path using C++. My personal preference is to use technology that is primarily focused on all features being based around programming so I decided on Unity.
